Webhook implementation for the most popular contact form builders: Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms and Elementor forms

== Description ==

WeTech Contact Forms Webhook allows you to set up the webhooks for any of your contact forms created with the help of such plugins as: Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms and Elementor forms.
The list of supported contact form plugins will be extended soon. So, please, don't worry if your favourite plugin isn't supported yet.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `wetech-contact-forms-webhook` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. For the Gravity Forms and Elementor forms you will find all the necessary settings in the 'WeTech Webhooks' menu entry in your WordPress admin panel.
1. For the Contact Form 7 you should go to the Edit page of the desired form you want to connect to the webhook. There you will see the "Webhook" tab, where all the required settings are located.
1. When you found those settings, you will have to set there a unique token (you can generate the token inside your account settings in the WeTech CRM application). Also, you have to configure form fields mapping - so all the form fields you created within any of the listed plugins will be linked to the appropriate field in the CRM.
